# NEXT STEPS - Quick Reference

## What We Have Now ✅

1. **V1.0 Baseline** - Working code
   - 533,903 numbers/sec  
   - Perf data collected
   - Bottlenecks identified: 136M branch misses, slow modulo/div

2. **Clean Structure**

3. **Clear roadmap** in README.md with technical explanations

## Workflow for Each New Version

```bash
# 1. Code new version
vim V2.0.cpp

# 2. Build it
./build.sh 2.0

# 3. Benchmark with perf
./bench.sh 2.0

# 4. Add results to PERFORMANCE.md table
# Copy metrics: Num/sec, Instructions, Cycles, IPC, misses
# Add observation: what changed, what improved

# 5. Compare to previous version
# Did we reduce instructions?
# Did IPC improve?
# Did branch/cache misses decrease?
```

---

## Next Version to Implement: V2.0

**What:** Replace modulo and division with bitwise operations

**File:** `V2.0.cpp`

**Changes:**
```cpp
// OLD (V1.0):
if (n % 2 == 0) 
    n = n / 2;

// NEW (V2.0):
if (n & 1)        // 0 = even, 1 = odd
    n >>= 1;       // Right shift = divide by 2
```

**Expected Results:**
- 2-3x faster (1-1.5M numbers/sec)
- Fewer instructions
- Higher IPC
- Fewer branch misses (maybe)

**Time to implement:** 15 minutes

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Build specific version
cd secuncialTech
./build.sh 2.0

# Benchmark
./bench.sh 2.0

# Quick test (no perf)
./V2.0 0 10000

# Compare versions
diff V1.0.cpp V2.0.cpp
```

## Performance Table Format

When adding to PERFORMANCE.md:

```
| 2.0 | Bitwise ops | -O0 | X | Y | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | What changed and why |
```

Where:
- X = numbers/sec
- Y = time in ms
- A = total instructions
- B = total cycles
- C = IPC (instructions per cycle)
- D = cache misses
- E = branch misses
- F = L1D cache misses
- G = L1I cache misses

Get these from `perf stat` output!

## Keep Asking Yourself

1. What's the bottleneck? (check perf stats)
2. What operation is slowest? (IPC, cache miss, branch miss?)
3. Can I eliminate instructions?
4. Can I reduce memory access?
5. Can I make branches more predictable?

**Focus: Just performance. Numbers don't lie.**
